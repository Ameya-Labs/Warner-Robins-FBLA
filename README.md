'''
will need to be updated. You can convert a regular image to SVG using [this online converter](https://convertio.co/jpg-svg/). Also update `favicon.ico` under `/public`. You can convert a regular image to ICO using [this online converter](https://convertio.co/png-ico/).

![firestore-data](./docs/firestore-data.png)

### Hosting on Website <a name = "hosting"></a>

Now that all the code and services are set up, one of the last steps is hosting onto a website. We will use Firebase Hosting for this.

50. Run `firebase login` in a Terminal/CMD window in your project folder. Follow the login steps that appear.
51. Run `firebase init`, and follow the steps in the images below, selecting the same options (IMPORTAN: Say "N" to all prompts asking to overwrite any files).

![firebase-hosting-1](./docs/firebase-hosting-1.png)
![firebase-hosting-2](./docs/firebase-hosting-2.png)
![firebase-hosting-3](./docs/firebase-hosting-3.png)
![firebase-hosting-4](./docs/firebase-hosting-4.png)
![firebase-hosting-5](./docs/firebase-hosting-5.png)
![firebase-hosting-6](./docs/firebase-hosting-6.png)

52. Run `npm run build`
53. Run `firebase deploy`

The platform should be live on the Firebase website. An example site is ameyalabs-fbla.web.app/. In your Firebase Console -> Cloud Firestore, you should see new data under "db_store" and "email_templates". An Adviser account has temporarily been created so you can log into the system and make youself an account. Please be sure to delete this temp Adviser account once you successfully create an account for yourself.

The temp Adviser account credentials are...
```
Email: ameyalabs-fbla@gmail.com
Password: AmeyaLabsFBLA123
```

### Last steps <a name = "laststeps"></a>

54. Navigate to "Rules" tab of "Cloud Firestore" in the Firebase console. Replace the current rules you see with the following...
```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
      allow read;
    }
  }
}
```
